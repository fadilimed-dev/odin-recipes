        <li>Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 5 minutes until it bubbles. Stir in flour, salt, and olive oil, and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth. Place it in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce: Mix the tomato sauce with oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Place the dough on a greased baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce evenly over the dough. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
