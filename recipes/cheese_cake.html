    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 packages (8 oz each) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter until combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan to form the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Add vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each one is fully incorporated. Stir in the sour cream until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the crust. Smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly open for 1 hour to cool gradually.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Serve plain or with your favorite toppings like fresh berries, whipped cream, or chocolate sauce.</li>
